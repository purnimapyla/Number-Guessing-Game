# Number-Guessing-Game
Built a CLI game where the user has to guess a randomly generated number within a limited number of attempts. After each guess, the program informed the user whether their guess was too high or too low. If the user guessed correctly, they won; otherwise, if they exhausted all attempts, the game ended, and the correct number was revealed.
